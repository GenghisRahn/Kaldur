# Kaldur

Kaldur is the reason why I decided to learn how to code, I've had this idea for a web app that doesn't exist yet, and I want to build it. I've tried multiple times in the past to learn how to program but i've never had something really pushing me to make it happen, so here it is. I'm starting today, applying everything i've learned thus far, and no doubt going to learn so much through this pursuit.
